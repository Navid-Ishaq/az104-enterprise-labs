# [2] Working with resource tags

This lab guide provides enterprise-ready, scenario-driven walkthroughs for mastering key Azure administrator tasks aligned with the AZ-104 certification.

#### 🧠 *Expectations vs. Reality*

Emma had heard about Azure resource tags during one of BrightOps Technologies’ planning meetings, but it always sounded like a “techie” thing to her. As the Operations Lead, she wasn’t usually hands-on with the platform — that was more Liam’s domain.

So when Liam suggested she try the tagging lab herself, Emma laughed. “Me? Create a virtual machine? I can barely manage our Google Sheets.”

Liam grinned. “Trust me, it’s not rocket science. I’ll walk you through it. You’ll see why it matters so much.”

Emma agreed, half-curious, half-nervous. She was eager to understand what her team dealt with — but also worried she’d mess something up.

#### 🖱️ *Taking the First Clicks*

Emma sat down at her desk with a fresh cup of coffee, logged into Azure, and opened up the instructions for the lab. With Liam and Jordan nearby (just in case), she followed the steps to create the virtual machine.

“Okay,” she muttered to herself. “Click ‘+ Create,’ then Azure Virtual Machine... Name it ‘resizeVM’...”

She took a deep breath. “I think I did that right.”

“Nice job,” Jordan said with a thumbs-up. “Now just pick the right region and image — the instructions say ‘East US’ and Windows Server 2019.”

Emma clicked through the tabs carefully, making sure to select the correct size and password. “This is actually more guided than I expected,” she said. “Kind of like building something in IKEA — with fewer screws.”

#### 🏷️ *The Aha Moment with Tags*

When Emma got to the tagging section, she hesitated.

“This part seemed so mysterious before,” she said. “But now I just add ‘Department’ and ‘IT’... and that’s it?”

Liam nodded. “Yep. Think of it like labeling a drawer. Makes it easy to find later.”

Emma clicked “Apply” and sat back. “That’s... surprisingly satisfying. I can already imagine this saving us hours.”

Then came the filtering part. She applied the tag filter to the resource group — and boom — the tagged VM popped up like magic.

“I feel like I just unlocked a superpower,” she laughed.

#### ⚠️ *Tiny Setback, Big Lesson*

Not everything went perfectly, though.

While clicking around the filters, Emma accidentally applied the wrong tag value at first — something like "department = HR" — and saw nothing show up. “Wait, where did it go? Did I delete it?” she asked, a hint of panic in her voice.

Liam peeked over her shoulder. “No worries. You just used the wrong tag filter. Switch it back to ‘IT.’”

She tried again, and there it was.

Emma exhaled. “Whew. Okay, minor scare — but I get why filtering properly really matters now.”

It was a small mistake, but it taught her the importance of consistency in tagging. One typo, and things can go missing in plain sight.

#### ✅ *Wrapping It All Up*

After confirming she could see the resource using the right tag filter, Emma moved on to the final step: deleting the resource.

“I like that this lab ends with a cleanup,” she said. “I always feel bad leaving stuff behind.”

Click, click, done.

Jordan leaned over. “So, how’d it feel running your first cloud task?”

Emma smiled. “Honestly? Not bad at all. I thought I’d break something — but now I kind of want to try another one.”

---

#### 🌱 *What Emma Learned*

By the end of the lab, Emma had learned much more than how to create a virtual machine. She’d learned:

* That tagging resources is simple, but powerful
* That visibility and organization can prevent cloud chaos
* That small mistakes (like wrong filters) are great teachers
* And most of all, that cloud tools aren't just for the “tech folks”

“Now when someone talks about resource groups or tags,” she told Liam later, “I don’t feel lost. I’ve been there.”

---

#### 📈 *From Doubt to Confidence*

Before the lab, Emma had seen Azure as something a bit intimidating — a place for engineers, not operations leads. But walking through each step gave her new confidence.

“I’m not going to pretend I’m a cloud expert,” she said. “But now I understand *why* we use these tools. And that makes me a better team lead.”

Liam nodded. “That’s exactly the goal. You don’t have to know every setting — just understand the purpose behind them.”

With a newfound sense of clarity, Emma felt ready to work more closely with the IT team on resource tracking — maybe even help draft their internal tagging standards.

As she logged off, she said with a grin, “Next time we spin up a VM, I’ll be the one asking, ‘Did we tag this properly?’”

#### 💬 Final Thoughts: More Than Just a Lab

This wasn’t just a technical exercise for Emma — it was a bridge between departments. A simple task showed her how collaboration, visibility, and organization make the cloud manageable for everyone — not just those who write the code.

The next time BrightOps needs to track resources, Emma will be leading the charge — not just from an operations desk, but from firsthand understanding.
