### 🧩 Uh-oh, a Problem!

At **BrightTech Solutions**, Sarah, Mike, and their favorite intern John were deep in cloud chaos. Virtual machines everywhere. No one knew who created what. Bills piling up.  
Sarah sighed, “Why do we have a VM named `temp-vm-7-final-final-V3` just sitting there?”  
Mike blinked. “I *think* that was for testing the new dashboard... or pizza ordering? Honestly, I’m not sure.” 😅

### 💻 Time to Get to Work!

Enter the team’s mission: *Lab 2 – Working with Resource Tags.*  
Step one: **Create a Virtual Machine.** John excitedly clicked through the Azure Portal like a gamer on launch day.  
“Resource group? Let’s name it `rg-brighttech-sarah`!”  
“VM name?” Sarah grinned. “Let’s call it `vm-tagmaster-01`. We mean business!”  
They chose **East US**, set the image to **Windows Server 2019**, and picked a cozy size: **B1s**. Boom—virtual machine created.

### 🏷️ Tools in Action!

“Alright,” said Mike, “now let’s slap on a tag like a sticker at a garage sale.”  
They opened **Tags**, typed **Name: Department**, **Value: IT**, and clicked **Apply**.  
Sarah tilted her head. “That’s it? That’s tagging?”  
“Yep,” John nodded, “and just like that, our VM is *findable*, *trackable*, and *adorable*.”

### 🔍 Filter Power Activated!

Next challenge: **Filter by tag.**  
Sarah clicked “Add Filters,” picked **Department = IT**, and gasped—*only their tagged VM showed up*.  
“Whoa,” she said. “This is like sorting your inbox by labels… but for expensive cloud things!”  
Mike wiped an imaginary tear. “It’s… beautiful.”

### 🧹 Success and High-Fives!

After their glorious filtering moment, the team cleaned up like pros—**deleted all the lab resources** with zero fear.  
Sarah leaned back, triumphant. “We didn’t just do a lab. We leveled up in cloud adulting.”  
John nodded. “From now on, no resource goes untagged under my watch.”  
*Cue high-five. Freeze frame. Roll credits.*

### 🚀 Moral of the Story?

**Tags = clarity.**  
**Filters = sanity.**  
**Azure + good habits = smooth sailing in the cloud.**

Stay sharp, stay tagged, and remember:  
> *In Azure... you gotta name it to tame it!*
