### 🧩 Uh-oh, a Problem!

At **BrightTech Solutions**, Sarah, Mike, and their favorite intern John were deep in cloud chaos. Virtual machines everywhere. No one knew who created what. Bills piling up.  
Sarah sighed, “Why do we have a VM named `temp-vm-7-final-final-V3` just sitting there?”  
Mike blinked. “I *think* that was for testing the new dashboard... or pizza ordering? Honestly, I’m not sure.” 😅  

---

### 💻 Time to Get to Work!

Enter the team’s mission: *Lab 2 – Working with Resource Tags.*  
Step one: **Create a Virtual Machine.** John excitedly clicked through the Azure Portal like a gamer on launch day.  
“Resource group? Let’s name it `rg-brighttech-sarah`!”  
“VM name?” Sarah grinned. “Let’s call it `vm-tagmaster-01`. We mean business!”  
They chose **East US**, set the image to **Windows Server 2019**, and picked a cozy size: **B1s**. Boom—virtual machine created.

---

### 🏷️ Tools in Action!

“Alright,” said Mike, “now let’s slap on a tag like a sticker at a garage sale.”  
They opened **Tags**, typed **Name: Department**, **Value: IT**, and clicked **Apply**.  
Sarah tilted her head. “That’s it? That’s tagging?”  
“Yep,” John nodded, “and just like that, our VM is *findable*, *trackable*, and *adorable*.”

---

### 🔍 Filter Power Activated!

Next challenge: **Filter by tag.**  
Sarah clicked “Add Filters,” picked **Department = IT**, and gasped—*only their tagged VM showed up*.  
“Whoa,” she said. “This is like sorting your inbox by labels… but for expensive cloud things!”  
Mike wiped an imaginary tear. “It’s… beautiful.”

---

### 🧹 Success and High-Fives!

After their glorious filtering moment, the team cleaned up like pros—**deleted all the lab resources** with zero fear.  
Sarah leaned back, triumphant. “We didn’t just do a lab. We leveled up in cloud adulting.”  
John nodded. “From now on, no resource goes untagged under my watch.”  
*Cue high-five. Freeze frame. Roll credits.*

---

### 🚀 Moral of the Story?

**Tags = clarity.**  
**Filters = sanity.**  
**Azure + good habits = smooth sailing in the cloud.**

Stay sharp, stay tagged, and remember:  
> *In Azure... you gotta name it to tame it!*

### 🌟 **Version A: “Slow-Mo Cloud Heroes” (Cinematic flair)**

🧹 **Success and High-Fives!**
After their glorious tag-filtering victory, the BrightTech trio stood tall. The cloud was clean. The logs were quiet. The resource group? Empty.

Sarah slid her chair back like a boss. “We didn’t just do a lab,” she said, tossing her coffee cup into the bin from across the room. *Swish.* “We just clouded... like champions.”

John clicked *Delete* one last time, then turned slowly. “From now on,” he said, pulling down his imaginary sunglasses, “every VM gets a name, a tag... and a purpose.”

Cue **slow-motion high-five**, electric guitar riff, screen fades to:

> “✨ *BrightTech Solutions — Azure Ready Since 2025* ✨”

### 😂 **Version B: “The Tag Squad Rides Again” (Humorous buddy-cop tone)**

🧹 **Success and High-Fives!**
With one final click, the last resource vanished. “Clean slate,” Mike whispered. “No orphans. No chaos.”

Sarah cracked her knuckles. “That’s how the Tag Squad rolls.”
John leaned over with a smirk. “Forget DevOps. We’re **TagOps** now.”

They stood up, dramatically walking out of the room...
...and immediately walked back in. “Wait,” Sarah said, “did we remember to tag the test VM in production?”
Mike blinked. “...RUN.” 🚨

---

### ✨ **Version C: “Legend of the Tagged VM” (Mythical ending)**

🧹 **Success and High-Fives!**
And so, the tagging trio completed their quest. The cloud was organized. The untagged beasts had been tamed.

Sarah raised her mouse like a sword. “We didn’t just do a lab. We brought balance to the cloud.”
John added a new policy, smiling. “From this day forward, no VM shall roam unnamed. No disk shall drift untagged.”

Mike etched their names into the team wiki under a new heading:

> **“Guardians of Governance: Volume One”**

They vanished into the Azure Portal mist... until the next resource group appears.
