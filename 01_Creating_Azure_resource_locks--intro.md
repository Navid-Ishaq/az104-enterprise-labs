This lab guide provides enterprise-ready, scenario-driven walkthroughs for mastering key Azure administrator tasks aligned with the AZ-104 certification.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-step walkthrough in a live Azure environment

In this lab, Alex ‚Äî a cloud administrator at **CloudCore Labs** ‚Äî explores how to protect resources in Azure by using **resource locks**. Here's a walkthrough of how he accomplishes this in a real Azure setup using fictional, friendly, and professional naming conventions.

---

#### ‚úÖ Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine

Alex begins by signing in to the **Azure portal** and deploying a virtual machine to work with.

1. In the **Azure portal**, he selects **Create a resource** > **Virtual Machine**.

2. He fills out the basic configuration:

   * **Resource Group**: `rg-cloudcore-alex`
   * **VM Name**: `vm-cloudcore-linux01`
   * **Region**: East US
   * **Availability Options**: No infrastructure redundancy required
   * **Security Type**: Trusted launch virtual machines
   * **Image**: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - Gen2
   * **Size**: B2s
   * **Authentication Type**: Password
   * **Username**: `alexadmin`
   * **Password**: `SecureP@ssword123`

3. On the **Disks** tab:

   * **OS Disk Type**: Standard SSD (Locally-redundant Storage)

4. Alex clicks **Review + create**, validates the configuration, and hits **Create** to deploy the VM.

---

#### ‚úÖ Task 2: Add a Delete Lock to the Virtual Machine

Once `vm-cloudcore-linux01` is deployed, Alex wants to ensure it isn‚Äôt accidentally deleted.

1. From the VM's **Overview**, he navigates to **Settings** > **Locks**.
2. He clicks **Add** and configures:

   * **Lock Name**: `lock-vm-delete`
   * **Lock Type**: **Delete**
3. Clicking **OK** applies the lock successfully. Now the VM cannot be deleted unless the lock is removed.

---

#### ‚úÖ Task 3: Add a Read-Only Lock to the Resource Group

To further protect the resource group, Alex adds a **Read-only lock**:

1. He navigates to the resource group `rg-cloudcore-alex`.
2. Under **Settings**, he selects **Locks** and clicks **Add**.
3. He enters:

   * **Lock Name**: `lock-rg-readonly`
   * **Lock Type**: **Read-only**
4. After clicking **OK**, all resources in the group are now read-only, preventing changes unless the lock is removed.

---

Once the demo is complete and the learnings are captured, Alex removes the locks and deletes all associated resources to clean up the environment.

This step-by-step guide introduces practical knowledge of **Azure resource locks** to safeguard deployments from unintentional modifications or deletions ‚Äî a critical best practice in enterprise environments.


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clear definition of the lab‚Äôs purpose and Azure tools used

### ‚úÖ Purpose: Strengthening Resource Protection through Azure Governance

The core objective of this lab is to teach learners how to **safeguard Azure resources** from accidental deletion or modification using **Azure Resource Locks**. In enterprise environments, cloud resources are often managed by multiple teams or automated processes, which increases the risk of unintentional changes. This lab empowers learners with the skills to prevent such scenarios by applying simple but powerful controls that enforce intentionality and discipline in cloud operations.

### ‚úÖ Real-World Value: Preventing Downtime and Data Loss

Accidental deletion of a virtual machine or misconfiguration of a resource group can result in service downtime, data loss, or even security breaches. This lab demonstrates how using **Delete** and **Read-only** locks protects these assets without impacting their availability or monitoring capabilities. The configuration mimics what a cloud administrator would do in a production scenario to implement **preventive safeguards** without restricting daily operations.

### ‚úÖ Practical Learning in a Controlled Environment

Using a fictional company (**CloudCore Labs**) and a named resource group (**rg-cloudcore-alex**), the learner acts as the Azure admin, Alex, to simulate deploying and protecting a critical virtual machine (**vm-cloudcore-web01**). The scenario is kept realistic and approachable, giving learners hands-on practice in applying **role-appropriate security settings** with a clear outcome and measurable success criteria.

### ‚úÖ Building Core Skills in Azure Governance

One of the most valuable takeaways from this lab is understanding how **Azure Locks** fit into broader **cloud governance frameworks**. Rather than diving into complex policies, this lab focuses on a foundational concept: preventing unauthorized or accidental changes by setting explicit restrictions. This is especially useful for learners pursuing roles in **cloud administration**, **DevOps**, or **platform operations**.

### ‚úÖ Introduction to Scope and Granularity of Locking

The lab also introduces an important concept in cloud governance: **lock scope**. Learners will see how a **Delete lock** applied to a single VM differs from a **Read-only lock** applied at the resource group level. This teaches the value of applying the right control at the right level, depending on the business or operational need ‚Äî a crucial decision-making skill in real-world cloud environments.

### ‚úÖ Lifecycle Awareness and Cleanup Practices

Another objective of the lab is to reinforce **lifecycle awareness**. After deploying and protecting the resources, learners are instructed to remove the locks and clean up the environment. This final step reflects standard practices in real organizations where cloud engineers are expected to **manage costs**, **prevent resource sprawl**, and ensure **compliance** by cleaning up test or temporary environments.

### ‚úÖ Summary: From Learning to Real-World Readiness

By completing this lab, learners gain hands-on experience with **resource provisioning**, **protection**, and **cleanup** ‚Äî three pillars of effective cloud operations. More importantly, they learn how to implement changes with confidence, knowing that **Azure tools like locks** exist to support safe, auditable, and governed deployment practices. These are essential skills for anyone managing cloud infrastructure in a professional setting.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Professional real-world scenario for practical context

### ‚úÖ Unexpected VM Deletions Trigger a Governance Review

At **CloudCore Labs**, a midsize cloud consultancy firm, the infrastructure team recently faced a setback: a development virtual machine hosting internal automation scripts was accidentally deleted during a bulk clean-up activity. While no customer-facing workloads were affected, the incident raised concerns around **resource governance** and **accidental deletions** in shared environments. As a result, leadership mandated improved safeguards for critical resources across all environments.

### ‚úÖ The CloudOps Engineer Steps In

To meet this new directive, the **Azure administrator**, Alex, was tasked with strengthening resource protection for frequently accessed infrastructure, especially virtual machines used in testing and staging. His solution needed to be simple, quick to implement, and natively integrated into **Azure's governance model**. Drawing from best practices, he proposed implementing **Azure Resource Locks** ‚Äî a low-cost, high-value safeguard.

### ‚úÖ Launching a Secure Test Environment

As part of a proof of concept, Alex created a new resource group named **rg-cloudcore-alex** and deployed a test Linux virtual machine called **vm-cloudcore-web01**. This VM was configured with **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS**, **Standard SSD**, and deployed in the **East US** region. The setup mirrored the infrastructure of actual dev environments used by engineering teams. This hands-on step allowed him to simulate production-like conditions for testing governance controls.

### ‚úÖ Applying a Delete Lock to Prevent Accidental Removal

To address the original problem ‚Äî unintended deletion ‚Äî the Azure admin applied a **Delete lock** directly to the virtual machine. This lock ensures that any attempt to remove the VM, whether from the portal, scripts, or CLI, is blocked unless the lock is first manually removed. This action provides an added layer of intentionality and helps prevent disruptions caused by hasty clean-up scripts or miscommunication between teams.

### ‚úÖ Enforcing Read-Only Controls at the Resource Group Level

Recognizing that changes to network, storage, or compute settings could still pose risks, Alex went further. He applied a **Read-only lock** to the **rg-cloudcore-alex** resource group. This lock disables modification of any contained resources without completely restricting visibility or monitoring. For shared resource groups used by junior engineers or third-party vendors, this lock becomes a critical **operational safeguard**.

### ‚úÖ Demonstrating Operational Impact to Stakeholders

After implementing these locks, Alex invited the broader DevOps team to validate access scenarios. Developers could still SSH into the VM, monitor logs, and use the resource group for read access, but no destructive or configuration-changing actions were allowed. This simple governance measure quickly gained favor with team leads, who saw it as a smart, non-intrusive way to maintain **stability during sprints and deployments**.

### ‚úÖ Enabling Scalable Governance Across Projects

The success of this lab-driven approach led to a templated rollout of **resource lock policies** via **Azure Blueprints** and **ARM templates**, helping CloudCore Labs standardize protection across environments. By showing how **Azure Locks** fit into real IT operations, the Azure admin contributed not just to uptime but also to building a **culture of cloud responsibility and prevention**.

### ‚úÖ Practical Skills for Enterprise Cloud Admins

This scenario highlights how a simple lab exercise prepares Azure professionals to handle **real-world incidents**, implement **proactive controls**, and support **business continuity**. By mastering tools like **Delete locks**, **Read-only locks**, and structured VM deployment, learners like Alex build the confidence and technical fluency needed for **enterprise-grade cloud governance**.

He started by provisioning a **Linux virtual machine** named **vm-cloudcore-web01** within a newly created resource group **rg-cloudcore-alex**. This task was carried out using the **Azure portal**, allowing him to select specific configurations such as **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS**, **B2s VM size**, and **Standard SSD** disk ‚Äî effectively simulating a production-ready environment for governance testing.

### ‚úÖ Implementing Azure Resource Locks Effectively

Once the virtual machine was live, the cloud engineer followed through by applying a **Delete lock** to the VM. This ensured that the resource could not be accidentally or programmatically deleted, aligning directly with the governance goals triggered by the earlier incident at **CloudCore Labs**. The successful application of this lock demonstrated his understanding of **Azure resource protection features** and how they prevent unintentional disruptions in operational environments.

### ‚úÖ Applying Broader Scope Governance

Going beyond single-resource protection, the Azure admin extended his efforts by applying a **Read-only lock** to the entire **rg-cloudcore-alex** resource group. This action reflected a strategic approach to governance, ensuring that **all resources within the group** ‚Äî including network interfaces, disks, and the VM ‚Äî were secured from configuration changes. The broader scope of this lock was a smart move for staging and shared project environments.

### ‚úÖ Practical Outcomes Met the Business Need

The results clearly matched the goal outlined in the professional scenario: to safeguard important infrastructure against accidental changes. By applying the locks, the Azure admin implemented a **simple yet powerful control mechanism** that can be adopted across other teams within CloudCore Labs. These actions directly contributed to enhanced **operational efficiency**, **incident prevention**, and **policy adherence** ‚Äî all critical elements in professional IT operations.

### ‚úÖ Challenges Considered and Overcome

While no major technical challenges were encountered, the Azure admin did need to plan the **scope of each lock** carefully. He ensured that the Read-only lock on the resource group wouldn't hinder necessary monitoring and log access ‚Äî a key balance to maintain in real-world environments. His thoughtful approach showed a mature understanding of **permissions granularity** and its impact on team workflows.

### ‚úÖ Opportunities for Further Enhancement

Although the locks were applied manually through the portal in this lab, the reflection revealed potential for future optimization. In production scenarios, it would be beneficial to integrate these governance measures using **Azure Policy**, **ARM templates**, or **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** tools like **Bicep** or **Terraform**. This would allow for **scalable, repeatable, and automated protection** across environments.
