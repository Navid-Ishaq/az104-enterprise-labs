This lab guide provides enterprise-ready, scenario-driven walkthroughs for mastering key Azure administrator tasks aligned with the AZ-104 certification.

## 🎉 **Comic-Style Summary: “The Great Cloud Lockdown!”**

### 🧠 Meet the Cast!

At *BrightOps Solutions*, cloud newbies **Ayesha** and **Omar** are tasked with a mission: keep their team from building stuff all over the Azure world. Guided by their ever-wise mentor **Rohan**, they set out to create an invisible forcefield that only allows cloud resources to be built in... **UK South**! 🇬🇧

---

### 🚨 Uh-oh, a Problem!

“Hey… why are some of our servers popping up in **East US**?” Ayesha asked, squinting at the Azure dashboard. Omar gasped, “That’s not even our continent!” Rohan popped in calmly with his mug of tea: “Sounds like we need to set some **rules** before this cloud turns into chaos.”

---

### 🔧 Time to Get to Work!

Off they zoomed into the **Azure Portal**, capes flapping (okay, maybe just hoodies). Ayesha typed in **Policy**, found the **“Allowed locations”** rule, and scoped it to their test group `rg-brightops-ayesha`. “Only **UK South** allowed,” she declared like a true governance hero. Omar clicked **Review + create** dramatically. *Boom!* The policy was in place!

---

### ⚙️ Tools in Action!

Now came the real test. Omar tried to sneak in a **Virtual Network** in **East US**. *DENIED!* “Haha! The cloud said nope!” Ayesha laughed. The validation error popped up, just as expected. Then they changed the region to **UK South**, clicked create, and voilà—green lights all around. The forcefield held strong!

---

### 🎉 Success and High-Fives!

Back at their (virtual) desk, Rohan gave them a digital high-five. “You’ve just enforced cloud governance like pros!” he said proudly. The team had learned that **Azure Policy** wasn’t just some scary tool—it was like a **cloud babysitter** that keeps everyone playing in the right sandbox.

### ✨ What We Learned (Without Falling Asleep)

* **Azure Policy** helps teams avoid cloud chaos
* You can **restrict regions** to meet legal and cost rules
* **Enforcement** blocks mistakes before they happen
* A quick 30-minute lab can teach **big real-world skills**

Now, Ayesha and Omar are cloud rule-setters—and the cloud is a little more peaceful. 🛡️☁️
