_By Siraat AI Academy | Curated & Clarified by Mr. Jamalu_

Welcome to the **AZ-104 Enterprise Labs** repo — not just a collection of labs, but a carefully crafted journey to help aspiring professionals **master Azure administration through real-world projects**, soulful storytelling, and hands-on clarity.

Every lab here is taught in the voice of **Jamalu** — not a professor, but a patient guide who believes **cloud knowledge should be understandable, usable, and human**.

## 📦 What’s Inside

Each folder in this repository contains a structured Azure Lab focused on enterprise scenarios you'll actually encounter in the field.  
We don’t just teach the “how” — we explain the “why,” just like you’d want before doing client work.
