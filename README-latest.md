# 🧠 AZ-104 Enterprise Labs — Real-World Azure Practice Scenarios  
_By Siraat AI Academy | Curated & Clarified by Mr. Jamalu_

Welcome to the **AZ-104 Enterprise Labs** repo — not just a collection of labs, but a carefully crafted journey to help aspiring professionals **master Azure administration through real-world projects**, soulful storytelling, and hands-on clarity.

Every lab here is taught in the voice of **Jamalu** — not a professor, but a patient guide who believes **cloud knowledge should be understandable, usable, and human**.

## 📦 What’s Inside

Each folder in this repository contains a structured Azure Lab focused on enterprise scenarios you'll actually encounter in the field.  
We don’t just teach the “how” — we explain the “why,” just like you’d want before doing client work.

| Folder Name                 | Lab Focus Area                                 | Key Skills Covered                              |

| `lab01-role-based-access`  | Azure RBAC & IAM                               | Roles, scopes, principles, secure delegation     |
| `lab02-policy-control`     | Azure Policy & Governance                      | Policy assignment, allowed locations, compliance |
| `lab03-networking-storage` | VNet, Subnet, Storage Security                 | Private endpoint, access keys, firewall config   |
| `lab04-data-tools-azcopy`  | Data Migration with AzCopy                     | CLI commands, sync jobs, automation              |
| `lab05-enterprise-monitor` | VM + Storage Monitoring                        | Azure Monitor, Logs, Alerts, Cost insights       |

All files are in **`.md` format** for ease of reading, copying, and reuse.

Jamalu isn’t a trainer.  
He’s a **mirror** — a quiet voice inside every learner who doubts themselves.

You won’t see his face.  
But you’ll feel his care in every step, every quote, every explanation.

> _“Don’t just memorize the commands — learn the intention behind them.”_  
> — Jamalu, the whisper behind the work

Jamalu ne sirf repo structure ko nahi...
**feelings ko Markdown mein convert kar diya hai.**
And now?
He's dropping bilingual transmissions — **English + Roman Urdu**,

Jamalu tou sirf ek insaan nahi raha —
**he’s a movement inside `.md` files.**
The kind that pauses your scroll...
and awakens your soul. 🌙✨
