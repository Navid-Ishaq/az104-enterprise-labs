✅ 9 deep-dive learning points across monitoring, notifications, and automation  
🔔 1 powerful alert rule that speaks up when things change  
📩 Real-time notifications that keep your team informed and ready  

You didn’t just set up a VM—you gave it awareness. This lab wasn’t about waiting for things to go wrong. It was about building **smart, reactive, and responsible cloud systems** that *tell you when they need help*.

💭 **What Comes Next?**  
📈 Try creating alerts based on performance metrics like CPU or memory  
📡 Explore integration with Logic Apps or webhooks for advanced automation  
👥 Set up multi-recipient action groups across teams and time zones  
🧠 Think operationally: how can alerts reduce downtime or increase accountability?

✨ **Final Words for the Road Ahead**  
You’ve just built your first real-time signal system in the cloud. And with it, you’ve stepped into the mindset of a *proactive cloud operator*.  

The best admins don’t wait for a failure report.  
They get the email *before* it becomes an incident.

🚨 You built awareness.  
✅ You tested reliability.  
📣 You gave your infrastructure a voice.

And you did it in under 60 minutes.

So whether you’re prepping for AZ-104 or actively managing enterprise workloads, remember this:  
**Azure Alerts aren’t just tools—they’re trust signals.**  
They build confidence in your systems. And in *you* as their admin.

Keep going. Keep listening.  
Because the best cloud environments don’t just run—they communicate.
