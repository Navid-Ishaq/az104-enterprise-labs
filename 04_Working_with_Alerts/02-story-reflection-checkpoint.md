## ✅ Smart Guide: Rohan’s Azure Alert Lab Reflection

**Lab 4: Working with Alerts – 1 Hour Task**

---

### 🧠 What Rohan Expected

* Rohan thought the lab would be simple — just creating a VM and setting up alerts.
* He wasn’t too nervous but wasn’t 100% sure how the alerting system worked.
* Ayesha, his teammate, stayed on call to support and discuss as they worked together.

---

### 🛠️ What He Did

* Created a **Virtual Machine** using Windows Server 2022.
* Named it **resizeVM** and chose a small size to save costs.
* Then, he went to the **Alerts** section and:

  * Selected **All Administrative operations** as the alert condition.
  * Created an **action group** to receive email notifications.
  * Restarted the VM to **test the alert**.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* Finding the correct **signal (All Administrative operations)** took a moment.
* He nearly selected the wrong **resource group**, but caught the mistake.
* Unsure if the alert would actually send an email — waited anxiously.

---

### ✉️ What Happened

* After restarting the VM, **an alert email came in!**
* It confirmed the restart was detected — success!
* Rohan was relieved and excited — it worked as planned.

---

### 💡 What He Learned

* Alerts are like your **early warning system** — they let you know when something changes.
* Even **small setups** like this help avoid bigger issues later.
* Accuracy matters — one wrong setting could break the alert.

---

### 🚀 Confidence Now

* Rohan now feels **more confident** in using Azure Alerts.
* He wants to explore more alert types like **CPU or memory usage**.
* Ayesha and the team appreciated his effort — they plan to **use this setup across all demo VMs**.

### 🌱 Key Takeaway
